I have been a PhD student in Molecular Medicine at the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it) since October 2021. My Doctoral advisor is Professor [Andrea Crisanti](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.drcrisanti). 

My current project aims at reconstructing the transmission dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. In particular, we want to link multiple time series data (i.e., cases and deaths) and serological data in a unifying modelling framework capturing the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and quantifying changes in reporting and population’s immunity.

 I am currently a visiting PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), under the supervision of Doctor [Ilaria Dorigatti](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/i.dorigatti), to build new skills in mathematical modelling and for the analysis of epidemiological data. 
 
Previously, I received a joint Master's degree in Medical Biotechnologies-Molecular Medicine from the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it) and [Universität Ulm (Germany)](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/)  in 2020, with a final grade of 110/110 cum laude. Most recently, I have been awarded a one-year scholarship from the [Blanceflor foundation](https://blanceflor.se/the-foundation-2/) for my research period abroad.
