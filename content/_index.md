I am a  Doctoral Student from the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it). My Doctoral advisor is professor [Andrea Crisanti](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.drcrisanti) and I am currently a visiting PhD student at the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), under the supervision of doctor [Ilaria Dorigatti](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/i.dorigatti).

My Doctoral Thesis consists of finding improved solutions for Bioinformatics problems, using Graph Algorithms via non-classical techniques such as: 
- Parameterized Algorithms
- Restrictive class of inputs
- Generalizations of current problems/solutions

It also aims to find "Safe and Complete" solutions of such problems, and to implement and test the most promising solutions.

Previously, I was a Master Student from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/) at [University of Udine](https://www.uchile.cl/english). I worked under the supervision of [Gonzalo Navarro](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/). My final thesis intitled [The Labeled Direct Product Optimally Solves String Problems on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05290.pdf) is going to be published in Algorithmica.
