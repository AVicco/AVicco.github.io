summary : "In this paper we analyze the physical puzzle IcoSoKu and we propose its generalization called 3coSoKu. We prove the NP-completeness of the latter. Then we encode it both in the constraint programming language MiniZinc and in the logic programming paradigm of Answer Set Programming. We use our encodings to experimentally prove the conjecture that every initial state for IcoSoKu admits a solution."
